   <p class="intro"><b>We are the house of Gryffindor.</b></p> <p>Gryffindor is one of the four Houses of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and was founded by Godric Gryffindor, whom was also the creator of it. Gryffindors are known for their nerve, chivalry, daring, courage, bravery and determination.
   </p>
   <p>Gryffindor instructed the Sorting Hat to choose students possessing characteristics he most valued, such as courage, chivalry, nerve and determination, to be sorted into his house. The emblematic animal was a lion, and its colours were scarlet and gold. The reason why they chose the lion to be the representitive of the house is because the lion is an animal that shows bravery and intelligence.
